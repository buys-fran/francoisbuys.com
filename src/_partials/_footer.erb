  This site is part of my work as I learn in public, and I use it to share my thoughts
  and experiences on a variety of topics, including software development and personal
  development.

  <p>
  You'll find a mix of full-length essays and shorter notes here, and I hope you find something of value. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I built this site with BridgeTown, and you can find the public repository for it here.

  Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your time on my website.
