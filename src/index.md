# About me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Francois Buys, and it's a pleasure to
meet you. 

I am a full-stack ruby and javascript problem solver based in Cape Town, South Africa who
loves nothing more than creating new things and uplifting those around me. 

I have a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am deeply
committed to using my skills in software development to make a positive impact on my
community. 

This site is a place where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and projects as I
continue to grow and learn. I hope you will join me on this journey and share in my
growth.

As a senior software engineer at OmbuLabs, I am proud to be making an impact on the tech
community. 

I lead the Dev Tooling team where we focus on streamlining tools and documentation to
equip other engineers to better serve our clients.

I also have the privilege to work on a variety of Ruby and Javascript applications,
always striving to deliver exceptional quality code. In my role, I have had the
opportunity to work on some truly exciting projects and challenges, and I am constantly
learning and growing as a result.
