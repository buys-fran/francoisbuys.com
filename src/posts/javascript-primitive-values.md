They are a permanent part of our JavaScript universe. I can point to them, but I canâ€™t create, destroy, or change them.
 - Undefined,
 - Null,
 - Booleans,
 - Numbers,
 - BigInts,
 - Strings,
 - Symbols

Primitive values, [objects and functions](/garden/javascript:-objects-and-functions) are the only value types in javascript

**All primitive values are immutable**

Think of them as distant unreachable stars in the JS galaxy
